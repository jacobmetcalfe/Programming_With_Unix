## Description
This gives all of the Programming With Unix homeworks that I did, so I can review them later on. Some of the answers will be wrong, it then becomes your job to correct them, as this will not be used as a cheating device.

## Installation
Just click on the documents and download the Word documents to see them.

## Requirements
- Microsoft Word
- System that can run Linux terminal.

## Roadmap
I do not intend to update this repository. 

## Acknowledgments
